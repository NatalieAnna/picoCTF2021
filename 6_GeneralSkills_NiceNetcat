Description-
There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: $ nc mercury.picoctf.net 22342, but it doesn't speak English...
CTF:

# run netcat command
$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 22342
Output: 112 105 99 111 67 84 70 123 103 48 48 100 95 107 49 116 116 121 33 95 110 49 99 51 95 107 49 116 116 121 33 95 53 102 98 53 101 53 49 100 125 10

Netcat (or nc) is a utility used for monitoring, testing, and sending data across network connections (TCP and UDP).

# Basic functions:

$ netcat [options] host port
This will attempt to initiate a TCP connection to the defined host on the port number specified.

$ netcat -u host port
Send a UDP packet instead.

$ netcat -z -v domain.com 1-1000
Scans ports ("-z" option) rather than initiating a connection (the nmap utility is a better choice). "-v" for verbose information.

$ netcat -l 4444
Listen for TCP connections on port 4444.
On a second server, we can connect to the first machine on the port number:
$ netcat domain.com 4444
Any typed messages will appear on both the local and remote screen.

$ netcat -l 4444 > received_file
The ">" redirects all the output of netcat into the specified filename.

$ netcat domain.com 4444 < sent_file
Can use this file as input for the netcat connection we will establish to the listening computer. The file will be transmitted just as if we had typed it interactively:
$ netcat domain.com 4444 < sent_file
$ cat received_file
