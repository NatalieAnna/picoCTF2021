Description - 
I decided to try something noone else has before. I made a bot to automatically trade stonks for me using AI and machine learning. I wouldn't believe you if you told me it's unsecure! vuln.c nc mercury.picoctf.net 33411

Hint-
Okay, maybe I'd believe you if you find my API key.

$ wget <vuln.c file>

Python script to get API
  import requests
  url = 'http://mercury.picoctf.net'
  response = requests.get(url)
  print(response.text)
  
Output: 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>

    body {
        width: 35em;
        margin: 0 auto;
